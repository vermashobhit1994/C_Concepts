1. gcc -c *.c  -> To create the .o files from .c files

2. ar -rs libarithmath.a *.o
To make a library of name arithmath with lib denotes
that it is library file. 
-r denotes that insert the .o files to archieve.
-s denotes that add an index to archieve.


3. ar -t libarithmath.a
To see the contents of libarithmath

4. gcc -c driver_program.c -I../
here ../ in -I means header file from previous path.
Then it will generate the driver_program.o file.

5. nm driver_program.o 
To get the global symbols and function names.
Here all the function names and external library names are undefined.

6. gcc driver_program.o -o myexe
Make the executable file for the driver_program.o.
Here the libc.a functions (for e.g printf()) is automatically linked by linker
but the functions (e.g myadd,mysub,mymul,mydiv ) must be externally linked.

7. gcc driver_program.o -o myexe -larithmath
link the arithmath with the driver_program.o file.
This gives error since we don't know where the libarithmath.a file is .

8. gcc driver_program.o -o myexe -larithmath -L../
here -L is used to search for libarithmath.a libray in ../ location.    

NOte : While linking the order of arguments matter so always put the library 
file at end .
